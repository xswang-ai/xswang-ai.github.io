I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Data and Knowledge Research Group at [The University of New South Wales](https://unsw.edu.au/) (advised by UNSW [Scientia Professor Xuemin Lin](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lxue/)). From July 2017 to May 2021, I was a Ph.D. student in the Data and Knowledge research Group, supervised by Prof. Xuemin Lin. I received my master and bachelor degrees from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in the areas of graph databases and efficient query algorithms.
